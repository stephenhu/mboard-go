advertisements can be played on mboard devices whether it's a slideshow of
pictures, an animated picture, or video.  these are controlled centrally by
madsportslab and can appear in between or during games, like during a timeout.
content can be downloaded periodically to keep relevant and updated, or can be
tuned with some feedback from each of the devices, e.g. a camera could record
the number of people in each venue.
